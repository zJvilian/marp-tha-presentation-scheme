# Quick Start Guide

## Get Started in 5 Minutes

---

# Step 1: Create Your Markdown File

Simply create a new `.md` file in the `slides/` folder with this frontmatter:

```markdown
---
marp: true
theme: tha-theme
paginate: true
---
```

---

# Step 2: Write Your Content

Use standard Markdown syntax:

- Headers for slide titles
- Lists for bullet points
- Code blocks for code examples
- Images for visuals

Each `---` separator creates a new slide!

---

# Step 3: Build Your Presentation

Run one command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Your presentation will be in the `output/` folder! ðŸŽ‰
